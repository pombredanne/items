Introduction
------------

[Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)) is a cross-platform application framework that is used for developing application software that can be run on various software and hardware platforms with little or no change in the underlying codebase.

[Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)) (often referred to as golang) is a programming language created at Google.

This package allows you to write Qt applications entirely in Go.

Status
------

**WIP**

Most Qt functions are accessible from Go.

The package should already contain everything you need to build fully featured applications, the webengine/webview packages don't work on Windows though.

Please pin the repo to a commit that is known to work for you, because there have been no releases so far.
